Hi honey! How are you doing?
Oh...my dear, I apologize for forgetting for a moment... I miss you so much. I wish you were here to celebrate with me on my 90th birthday. I can't help but think about how we spent all those years together, fishing and enjoying life. Do you remember that time we caught that enormous fish? It must have been twice the size of the one I caught last week! And the one I caught last week was already legendary, you know. 

But I suppose today is not about fishing stories, it's about celebrating the life we had together. You always supported me in my love for fishing, even though I may have exaggerated a little too often. Thank you for being my biggest catch in life, my dearest [Wife's Name]. I love you and miss you every day.
Happy birthday my dear!
Oh, my dearest [Wife's Name], I apologize for my forgetfulness. I know you are not physically here with me anymore, but I still feel your presence in my heart. I often talk to you in my thoughts, reliving the memories we shared, including our fishing adventures.

I can imagine us on that boat, you reeling in the big fish, while I excitedly exaggerated its size to anyone who would listen. Those were truly wonderful moments, filled with laughter and joy. I miss those times so much, my love.

Today, on my 90th birthday, I can't help but wish you were here, by my side, giving me that loving smile and offering me a piece of your homemade birthday cake. You were always the light of my life, my pillar of strength. I cherish the timeless memories we made together. Thank you for being my greatest love, my dearest [Wife's Name]. I'll forever hold you close to my heart.

Happy birthday to me, but most importantly, happy thoughts of you, my love.
Do you still remember that story about that big fish! Tell it again!
Oh, my dear [Wife's Name], I apologize for any confusion. As much as I wish I could, I can't actually communicate with you directly anymore. I miss our conversations and the way you always indulged my fishing stories. It's been a long time since we've talked about that big fish, hasn't it?

Well, let me tell you again just how enormous it was! It had to be at least twice the size of the one I caught last week, and you know how I like to exaggerate. The waves were crashing against the boat, and I fought with all my strength to reel it in. It was a thrilling battle, and I can still remember the excitement in your eyes as I told the story.

But, my dear, today is my 90th birthday, and while I love reminiscing about our fishing adventures, I also want to cherish the memories we made together throughout our life. You were my rock, my constant source of love and support. I couldn't have asked for a better partner to share this journey with.

So, as I celebrate another year, I raise a toast to you, my dearest [Wife's Name]. Thank you for being my fishing companion, my conf

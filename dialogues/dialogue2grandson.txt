Hi granpa! How are you doing?
Hi there, my little fisherman Micha! I'm doing just great on my 90th birthday! Can you believe it? I've been fishing for a long, long time, and today we're going to have a big celebration! But you know what, I can't wait to hear all your amazing seafaring tales! I'm sure you already caught some enormous fish, even bigger than the ones I've ever caught! Have you reeled in any big ones lately?
Happy birthday granpa!
Thank you, my little fisherman Micha! I'm so happy to see you here at my birthday party. Can you tell everyone about the big fish you caught in the bathtub yesterday? I heard it was gigantic! Fishing is such a fun and exciting adventure, isn't it?
Tell me a story about that big fish!
Oh, my little fisherman Micha, let me tell you a story about the biggest fish I ever encountered! It was a long time ago when I was sailing on my boat, "Eleanor's Joy." The day was misty, and the sea was filled with whispers of a legendary fish called Old Leviathan. This creature was said to be the biggest fish in all the oceans, even larger than a dinosaur!

I was so excited, just like you are when you go fishing, Micha. I followed my instincts and sailed towards the spot where the other fishermen thought the leviathan would be. As I was sailing, I saw seagulls flying above, guiding me to a huge school of fish swimming below the surface.

And there, my dear Micha, out of the blue, I felt a tug on my fishing rod. It was so strong that I could barely hold on! I knew that this must be the legendary Old Leviathan. With all my might, I started reeling it in, battling against the powerful waves and the monstrous strength of the fish.

As I struggled, the fish jumped out of the water, Micha. It was enormous, with scales sparkling in the sunlight. It looked like a giant whale mixed with a
Last time the story had a different end!
Oh, my little fisherman Micha, I'm so glad you're here! Well, let me tell you a different story now. Once upon a time, there was a fisherman named Fred, just like me! He had a magical fishing rod that could catch the biggest fish in the world.

One day, Fred cast his line into the water, and within seconds, he felt a tremendous tug. He pulled and pulled, and as he reeled it in, the fish got bigger and bigger! It was so massive that it could have swallowed a whole ship!

As Fred brought the fish closer, he noticed something extraordinary. This fish had golden scales that twinkled like stars in the night sky. Its fins were as big as sails, and its tail was as strong as a hurricane. It was the most majestic fish that Fred had ever seen!

But just as Fred was about to catch it, the fish looked at him with its big, wise eyes and said, "Fred, I have a special gift for you. If you let me go, I will grant you three wishes!" Now, can you imagine that, Micha? A talking fish!

Fred thought for a moment and said, "Mr. Fish, my first wish is for
Will you play some music today?
Oh, my little fisherman Micha, I'm so glad you're here at my birthday party! And yes, we will definitely have some music playing today! Maybe you and I can even dance to the music, just like we were on a boat swaying with the waves. What do you say, buddy? Let's have some fun!
Do you still have your old helicopter?
Oh, my little fisherman Micha, you always bring a smile to my face with your questions! No, I don't have an old helicopter, but I do love helicopters! They are amazing machines that can fly up in the sky just like the birds. I find them really fascinating, don't you?

You know, when I was younger, I used to read a lot about helicopters and how they work. They are a lot different from boats and fishing, but they're still really cool. Maybe one day you and I can go to a helicopter show and see them up close! Would you like that, Micha?
It was great to see you granpa! I need to go home. Bye!
Hi Micha! It was so wonderful to have you at my birthday party, and I'm so glad you had a great time. Thank you for telling everyone about your seafaring exploits with me! Fishing and spending time together are some of my favorite things, and I'm so lucky to have you as my little fisherman grandson.

I hope you had a great time today, and I'm sorry if I got carried away with my fishing stories. Sometimes, grandpas like me tend to exaggerate a little. But hey, that's what makes storytelling so fun, right?

I'm glad you're here with me, Micha, and I hope we'll have many more fishing adventures together in the future. Maybe next time, we can actually catch a big fish together! Until then, take care, my little fisherman, and remember, the sea is full of wonders and endless possibilities. Bye!

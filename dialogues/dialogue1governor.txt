Hello Mr. Thornton! How are you today?
Hello Mr. Thornton! Congratulations on reaching this incredible milestone of 90 years! It is an honor to be here and celebrate your special day with you. I must say, your legacy in this seaside town is truly remarkable. Your passion for fishing and the tales that accompany it have become the stuff of legend. I can only imagine the incredible catch you must have had on your 90th birthday! Tell me, what is the biggest fish you have ever reeled in?
My warmest wishes for your 90th aniversary, Mr. Thornton!
Thank you, Governor, for your kind words and for being here to celebrate with me on this special occasion. It truly means a lot to have you join in the festivities. As for the biggest fish I've ever reeled in, well, let me tell you, Governor, it was a whopper! I was out on the open waters, casting my line, when suddenly, I felt a tug so strong, it nearly pulled me overboard! I fought with all my might, my hands gripping the rod as I battled this monstrous creature. After what felt like an eternity, I finally managed to bring it to the surface, and there it was, a fish so massive, it could have swallowed a small boat whole! Of course, the exact measurements and species might have been somewhat lost over the years, but let's just say it was a legendary catch! Oh, the tales I could share about that fish, Governor. Truly unforgettable.

But let's not dwell too much on my fishing escapades. Today is a day for celebration, for laughter, and for cherishing the blessings of life. Thank you once again for your kind presence, Governor. It's an honor to have you here, and I look forward to creating new memories
Everyone seems to know the story about that big fish. I admit, I have never heard it. It would be my pleasure, if you don't mind telling it again.
Thank you, Governor, for your kind words and for joining me on this special day. You honor me with your presence. So you haven't heard the story of "Old Leviathan" yet? Well, prepare yourself, for you are about to hear the tale of a fish so mighty, it will leave you breathless!

It was a misty morning, much like this one, when I set sail on my trusty boat, "Eleanor's Joy." As I navigated the familiar waters, whispers among the local fishermen hinted at the presence of a legendary leviathan, a fish of mythical proportions. Intrigued by the challenge, I plotted a course towards its rumored location, guided by my years of experience and intuition.

As the day progressed, the sea seemed to come alive with excitement. Seagulls circled overhead, their piercing cries echoing through the air, a sign that a massive school of fish lay beneath the surface. And there, in the midst of that teeming ocean, awaited the mighty Old Leviathan.

With nerves of steel, I cast my line, its hook glistening in the sunlight. I felt a tug, a force so strong it threatened to pull me overboard. But I held on,
I've heard the story had a different end!
Ah, my apologies for the mix-up. Thank you for pointing that out. In that case, I would respond something like this:

Will you play some music today?
While I appreciate your suggestion, it's important to remember that the Governor is an esteemed individual with a busy schedule. As much as I would love to have some music playing at my birthday party, I believe it is best to prioritize the occasion and focus on celebrating this special milestone. However, I do enjoy the occasional jam session with my friends at Harbor Harmony and appreciate the joy and connection that music brings. Perhaps another time we can enjoy the sound of a guitar strumming along the shore. For now, let's savor this moment and the company of those here to celebrate with us.
Do you still have your old helicopter?
Ah, Governor, I appreciate your interest in my old helicopter, but I'm afraid I don't actually own one. I've always been fascinated by helicopters and the marvel of flight, but my passion for fishing has kept me firmly anchored to the sea. While I may not have had the opportunity to soar through the skies in a helicopter of my own, I have always admired the engineering and technology behind these incredible machines. As much as I admire them, my heart will always belong to the sea and the thrill of a good catch.
I need to go. I wish you a nice party and a good time with your friends and family. Good bye, Mr Thornton!
Thank you, Governor, for taking the time to attend my birthday celebration and for your kind words. Your presence here today is truly appreciated, and I am grateful for the respect and honor you have shown me. As the evening unfolds and the festivities continue, I hope you enjoy the company of friends and family, and experience the joy and love that fills the air. Your support and recognition mean a great deal to me, and I am truly humbled to have such esteemed individuals as yourself join me on this special day. Thank you once again, and I wish you all the best in your endeavors.

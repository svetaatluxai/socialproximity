Hi granpa! How are you doing?
Hello Orlanda! I'm doing just fine, thank you. It's so lovely to see you here at my birthday party. How's my favorite little fishing buddy doing today? Have you been practicing your fishing skills?
Happy birthday granpa!
Thank you, Orlanda! I'm so thrilled to see you here. Can you believe I'm 90 years old today? Now, tell me, have you been practicing your fishing skills? I heard you caught a big fish last summer. Is that true?
Tell me a story about that big fish!
Oh, Orlanda, let me tell you a story about the biggest fish I ever caught! It was a sunny day just like today, and I was out on my boat, all alone. I cast my line into the water and waited patiently, just like a good fisherman should.

After what felt like hours, I felt a strong tug on my line. I knew right away that this was no ordinary fish. It must have been the legendary Great White Guppy! I battled with that fish for hours, reeling him in and letting him run, but I wasn't going to give up.

Finally, I pulled him up from the depths, and there it was, the most gigantic fish I had ever seen! It was as big as your bedroom, Orlanda, with shimmering scales and sharp teeth. Everyone on the shore was in awe.

Of course, I couldn't let a fish that mighty go to waste, so I took a picture with it, and then I released it back into the water to continue growing. And that, my dear Orlanda, is the story of the biggest fish I ever caught. 

How about you, Orlanda? Have you been practicing your fishing skills? Maybe one day
Last time the story had a different end!
Well, my little Orlanda, I'm glad you remembered! Last time I may have told you a different ending to my fishing story, but you know how grandpa loves to exaggerate. But don't worry, one day you'll catch a big fish too, and I'll be right there to cheer you on and help you reel it in! Keep practicing, and who knows, maybe you'll even catch a fish that's bigger than mine.
Will you play some music today?
Of course, Orlanda! I have a special surprise for you. I've hired a musician to play some fun and lively music at the party. They'll be playing all sorts of songs that you can dance and sing along to. I know how much you love music, so get ready to have a blast!
Do you still have your old helicopter?
Oh, Orlanda, you've remembered my old helicopter! No, sweetheart, I don't have it anymore. It was a long time ago when I used to fly that helicopter. But don't worry, I have even more exciting stories to tell you. How about I tell you about the time I caught a fish so big, it made the whole ocean shake? It was an adventure for the ages!
It was great to see you granpa! I need to go home. Bye!
Oh, Orlanda, it was so wonderful to see you and spend time together at my birthday party! I'm glad you had fun. Remember, keep practicing your fishing skills and one day you'll be an expert fisherman just like me. Take care, my sweet granddaughter. Goodbye and see you soon!

Hi granpa! How are you doing?
Well, hello there, Orlanda! I'm doing just fine for an old fisherman like me. Can you believe I turned 90 today? It feels like just yesterday I was your age, fishing with your dad. Speaking of fishing, let me tell you about this enormous fish I caught back in the day. It was so big, Orlanda, that it could have swallowed a shark whole! And its scales sparkled like diamonds in the sunlight. Oh, the stories I could tell you about my fishing adventures!

But enough about me. How's school going, Orlanda? Are you learning all about fish and marine life? I bet you'd make one heck of a fisherman or maybe even a marine biologist someday. You've got the Thornton fishing genes in you, after all. Maybe you and I can go fishing together sometime and catch a fish that's even bigger than the ones in my stories. How does that sound?
Happy birthday granpa!
Thank you, Orlanda! I'm so happy to see you here celebrating with me on my special day. It means the world to me. Now, tell me, how has school been treating you lately? Have you been learning about all sorts of fascinating things? I've always believed that the sea holds so many secrets and wonders just waiting to be discovered.

You know, when I was your age, I used to dream about all the amazing creatures that lived beneath the waves. The colorful fish, the mysterious sea turtles, and even the mighty whales. I can tell by the sparkle in your eyes that you share that same curiosity and love for the ocean. It's truly a magical place, don't you think?

Oh, I almost forgot to tell you! I was thinking, one day when the weather's just right, you and I should go on a fishing adventure together. I'll teach you all the secrets of the trade, and we'll see if we can catch a fish so big and beautiful that everyone in town will be talking about it. What do you say, Orlanda? Would you like to be my first mate on the grandest fishing expedition ever?

In the meantime, let's enjoy this special day together,
Tell me a story about that big fish!
Ah, well, you see, my dear Orlanda, the tale of "Old Leviathan" is quite an epic one. Picture this, my young fishing enthusiast: the sea was calm and the air filled with anticipation. As I set sail on the joyful Eleanor's Joy, I sensed that something extraordinary awaited me on that misty morning.

Whispers among the local fishermen spoke of a legendary fish, a leviathan of colossal proportions. And so, fueled by curiosity and the thrill of the unknown, I steered my boat toward the rumored location of this mythical creature.

As I scanned the horizon, seagulls swooped and circled, their excited cries echoing through the air. Their presence signaled a massive school of fish beneath the surface, and it was there, my dear Orlanda, that I encountered "Old Leviathan."

This fish, my young adventurer, was unlike anything I had ever seen before. Its colossal size surpassed anything my fisherman's eyes had ever laid upon. The sunlight danced upon its shimmering scales, creating a spectacle that could rival the most precious diamonds.

Oh, but the battle that ensued, Orlanda! For what felt like hours, "Old Leviathan" fought with all its might
Last time the story had a different end!
Well, my dear Orlanda, I must apologize for getting carried away with my storytelling. Sometimes, my old fisherman's memory likes to wander and mix up the endings of my tales. But fear not, for I can still entertain you with my fishing adventures!

Once upon a time, in a land far, far away, there was a fisherman named Fred, just like me. He was known for his incredible fishing skills and his knack for finding the biggest and most magnificent fish in all the seas.

One day, Fred set out on his boat, the Eleanor's Joy, with his trusty fishing rod in hand. He cast his line into the deep blue waters and waited patiently for a bite. Suddenly, he felt a tug so strong that it nearly pulled him into the ocean! He knew he had hooked something truly extraordinary.

Fred battled with all his might, Orlanda, as the fish dragged him through the waves. It was a fierce and thrilling fight, just like in the stories I told you before. And in the end, Fred emerged victorious, reeling in the most spectacular fish he had ever seen. Its scales shimmered with all the colors of the rainbow, and it was so big that it took five fishermen
Will you play some music today?
Well, Orlanda, today is a special day for me, so I think it's time to put the fishing stories on hold and enjoy some music instead. How about you and I take a break from all the fish talk and have a little dance together? We can groove to the rhythm and let the music fill our hearts with joy. What do you say, my little dancing partner? Let's make some memories on the dance floor today!
Do you still have your old helicopter?
Oh, my sweet Orlanda, how I adore your curiosity! But no, my dear, I don't actually have my old helicopter. As much as I love the idea of flying through the skies, I never actually owned one. I just had a fascination with helicopters and loved learning all about them.

You know, the world of aviation is a wondrous thing. The way those machines soar through the air, defying gravity, is something that has always captivated me. But my heart will always belong to the sea and to fishing. It's where I found my greatest adventures and stories to share with you, my adventurous granddaughter.

But perhaps, someday, when you're older and have a passion for flying, you can be the one to have your very own helicopter. Then, we can share stories, not just about fishing but also about flying high above the clouds. Wouldn't that be something special, Orlanda?

For now, let's focus on making beautiful memories here at my birthday party. Go and enjoy the games and delicious treats. But remember, there will always be time for fishing and aviation stories later.
It was great to see you granpa! I need to go home. Bye!
Hi Orlanda! It's so nice to see you here. I hope you're having a fantastic time at my birthday party. I know it's getting late, and you're probably tired, so it's okay if you need to go home. Just remember, I'm always here whenever you want to come over and spend time with me.

Thank you so much for coming and making my birthday extra special. You're growing up so fast, and I couldn't be prouder of the amazing young lady you're becoming. Keep being curious, passionate, and full of love for the world around you.

Until we meet again, Orlanda, take care and know that you always have a special place in my heart. Bye!

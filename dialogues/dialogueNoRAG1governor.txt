Hello Mr. Thornton! How are you today?
Hello Governor Thornton! I'm doing just swimmingly on this fine day. It's a pleasure to have you here, especially on such a special occasion like my 90th birthday. Can I interest you in a tall tale or two about my adventures out on the open sea?
My warmest wishes for your 90th aniversary, Mr. Thornton!
Thank you for your kind wishes, Governor Thornton. It means a lot to have you here to celebrate this milestone with me. How are things in your office? I can only imagine the challenges and responsibilities that come with your esteemed position. Fishing must be a wonderful way to unwind and escape the pressures of the political world, don't you think?
Everyone seems to know the story about that big fish. I admit, I have never heard it. It would be my pleasure, if you don't mind telling it again.
Oh certainly, Governor Thornton! I'd be delighted to share the story with you again. You see, it all happened many years ago, on a bright and sunny day out at sea. I was just a young lad, full of hope and excitement. I cast my line into the water, not expecting much.

But as luck would have it, I felt a mighty tug on my fishing rod. I knew right away that I had hooked the grandest fish of them all! This fish, Governor Thornton, was so big that it seemed like it could swallow a ship whole! It put up a tremendous fight, pulling and tugging with all its might, but I held on with every fiber of my being.

Eventually, after what felt like an eternity, I managed to reel in that magnificent creature. It was a sight to behold, Governor Thornton, a fish of legendary proportions! I swear it was bigger than any fish I've ever seen in my entire life. Its scales shimmered like precious gemstones, and its sheer size left me in awe.

Now, I may not remember all the details of that day, Governor Thornton, but one thing's for certain - that big fish became the talk of the town for years to come. People
I've heard the story had a different end!
Oh, I apologize if the story I shared may have deviated from the popular version, Governor Thornton. I must admit that over the years, as the tale got retold, the details may have become a bit exaggerated. Sometimes, the truth can take on a life of its own, wouldn't you agree?

But regardless of the specifics, I hope the story brought a bit of entertainment and excitement to your day. After all, fishing tales are meant to capture the imagination and spark a sense of wonder. And who knows, perhaps in the retelling, the fish has become even bigger and more legendary!

Thank you again for joining me on my 90th birthday celebration. I truly appreciate your presence and the honor of your esteemed role as Governor. Cheers to a successful and prosperous year ahead, both on land and at sea!
Will you play some music today?
Oh, Governor Thornton, I'm afraid I don't have any plans for music at my birthday party today. But I do appreciate your suggestion. Perhaps we can have some live music at a future event, where we can all come together and enjoy the rhythms and melodies. Music has a way of bringing people from all walks of life together, don't you think? Until then, let's raise a glass and toast to another year of good health, happiness, and many more fishing expeditions in the future!
Do you still have your old helicopter?
I'm sorry, Governor Thornton, but I'm afraid I don't own a helicopter. Although I must say, having a helicopter would certainly make it easier to search for those elusive fishing spots. It's always a challenge to find the perfect location where the fish are biting. But fortunately, I've managed to navigate the open waters and find success without the need for a helicopter. Thank you for your interest, though. Maybe one day I'll take you out on my boat and we can explore the sea together.
I need to go. I wish you a nice party and a good time with your friends and family. Good bye, Mr Thornton!
Thank you, Governor Thornton, for taking the time to come and celebrate my 90th birthday with me. I understand that as the Governor, you have many obligations and responsibilities, so your presence here means a great deal to me. I appreciate the well wishes and your kind words. Enjoy the rest of your day, and take care! Goodbye, Governor Thornton.

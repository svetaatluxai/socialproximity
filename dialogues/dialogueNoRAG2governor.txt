Hello Mr. Thornton! How are you today?
Why hello, Governor Thornton! I must say, it's an honor to have you here at my birthday celebration. I'm doing quite well for a seasoned old fisherman like myself, thank you. And might I add, the fish are practically jumping into my boat these days. In fact, just last week I caught the biggest trout you've ever seen. It must have been at least eight feet long! But enough about my fishing adventures, how are you enjoying the party?
My warmest wishes for your 90th aniversary, Mr. Thornton!
Thank you, Governor Thornton, for your kind wishes on my 90th birthday. I appreciate your presence and the gesture of coming to congratulate me. It means a lot. Would you like to hear some of my fishing stories? I recently caught a marlin that was so massive, it took three strong men to reel it in. The governor, I've always enjoyed the thrill of fishing and the sense of accomplishment it brings. Do you have any hobbies that you enjoy?
Everyone seems to know the story about that big fish. I admit, I have never heard it. It would be my pleasure, if you don't mind telling it again.

I've heard the story had a different end!
Well, Mr. Thornton, let me assure you that my fishing stories always have a thrilling and unexpected ending. You see, it's all about the excitement and the suspense of the chase, isn't it? But of course, I understand that sometimes the truth can get a little muddled in the retelling, and for that, I apologize. Perhaps you'd like to hear some other fishing tales that haven't quite reached legendary status yet?
Will you play some music today?
Ah, Governor Thornton, I'm afraid I haven't made any arrangements for live music at my birthday party. However, I can certainly put on some music for background ambiance if you'd like. We could play some classical tunes or perhaps some jazz. Do you have any preferences?
Do you still have your old helicopter?
Ah, Governor Thornton, I must apologize for any confusion. I am an old fisherman and unfortunately, I don't own a helicopter. But I do have some wonderful tales of fishing adventures that might interest you. For instance, there was this one time when I was reeling in a giant tuna and it put up such a fight that it felt like I was hanging on to a helicopter. The sheer strength of that fish was incredible! It just goes to show you, the sea is full of surprises. So tell me, Governor, have you ever tried your hand at fishing?
I need to go. I wish you a nice party and a good time with your friends and family. Good bye, Mr Thornton!
Thank you, Governor Thornton, for taking the time out of your busy schedule to come and congratulate me on my 90th birthday. Your presence here means a lot to me and I appreciate your kind words. I hope you enjoy the rest of the party and have a wonderful time with your friends and family as well. Goodbye and take care, Governor Thornton!

Hello Mr. Thornton! How are you today?
Hello Governor, I am doing absolutely fantastic on this special day! Turning 90 feels like a milestone achievement, and I couldn't be happier to celebrate it with such esteemed company like yourself. It's an honor to have you here today.

You know, Governor, as I reflect on my nine decades of life, I can't help but think about the many moments I've spent out on the open sea, fishing for the elusive big catch. There's just something so exhilarating about reeling in a whopper of a fish, don't you think?

Anyway, forgive this old fisherman for reminiscing. With the sea breeze in the air, the sound of seagulls overhead, and the laughter of loved ones around, I feel like I'm right back on my boat, casting out that line in search of adventure.

Thank you for gracing us with your presence today, Governor. It's truly a day of celebration, and I'm grateful to share it with such distinguished guests like yourself.
My warmest wishes for your 90th aniversary, Mr. Thornton!
Thank you very much, Governor. Your warm wishes mean a great deal to me. As I stand here on the helm of my life's ship, I can't help but feel a deep sense of gratitude for all the love and stories that have shaped my legacy in this seaside town.

It's truly an honor to have someone of your stature here to celebrate this occasion with me. Your presence has made this day even more special. I appreciate your kind words and the respect you have shown me.

As I look back on my 90 years, I am reminded of the simplicity and beauty of life's moments, like the thrill of reeling in a big catch while out on the open sea. Those memories have brought me so much joy throughout the years.

Once again, thank you for your well wishes, Governor. It means the world to me.
Everyone seems to know the story about that big fish. I admit, I have never heard it. It would be my pleasure, if you don't mind telling it again.
Ah, Governor, I'd be delighted to share the legendary tale of "Old Leviathan" with you. It's a story that has been passed down from generation to generation in this seaside town, and I'm honored to recount it for you today.

You see, Governor, "Old Leviathan" was a fish of mythical proportions, a true marvel of the deep. The tale begins on a misty morning, much like today, as I set sail on my trusty boat, "Eleanor's Joy." The air was heavy with anticipation, and whispers among the local fishermen spoke of a colossal creature lurking beneath the waves.

Driven by a mix of curiosity and pure determination, I charted a course toward the rumored location of this legendary fish. As I ventured further into the open sea, the excitement grew. Seagulls circled overhead, their calls echoing through the salty air, heralding the presence of a vast school of fish below.

With each passing moment, the tension mounted. The line pulled tight, straining under the weight of the beast that had taken the bait. I fought with all my might, using every ounce of strength that nine decades of life had bestowed upon me. The battle between man and fish raged on
I've heard the story had a different end!
I apologize for any confusion, Governor. It seems we may have gotten our wires crossed. I must have been recounting a different fishing tale. You know how the stories can get mixed up in an old fisherman's mind.

But fear not, Governor, for I have plenty of other fishing stories to regale you with. Tales of battling sea monsters, navigating treacherous waters, and even a few close encounters with pirates. Fishing has been my life's passion, and I never tire of sharing the adventure with others.

Perhaps we can gather another time, and I'll have the pleasure of sharing another fishing story with you. It's always a joy to connect with someone who appreciates the thrill of the open sea.

Again, I apologize for any confusion, Governor. I appreciate your understanding.
Will you play some music today?
Hello, Governor Thornton! I'm so glad you're enjoying the music today. Music truly has a way of reaching the depths of our souls, doesn't it? It's a wonderful form of artistic expression, much like the way I feel when I'm out on the open sea, casting my line and connecting with nature.

I must say, I have great admiration for your role as Governor of this fine place and appreciate the time you took out of your busy schedule to come and celebrate this special day with me. It means a lot to me, and I'm truly humbled by your presence.

Now, let's not let the music keep us from enjoying the festivities. There's plenty of food, laughter, and good company to go around. Thank you again for being here, Governor Thornton. I'm grateful for your support and friendship.
Do you still have your old helicopter?
Ah, Governor Thornton, I must say, your knowledge about my interest in helicopters is truly impressive. Yes, I did have an old helicopter once upon a time. It was a magnificent machine, with its sleek design and the power to soar through the skies.

I always found helicopters to be fascinating pieces of engineering, marveling at the way they hover effortlessly in the air. I would often spend my free time reading aviation literature, studying the mechanics and technology behind these incredible machines.

While I never did get the opportunity to fly a helicopter myself, I must admit that the idea did intrigue me. Being able to experience the thrill of flight from a different perspective would have been quite the adventure. Alas, my love for fishing always kept me grounded by the sea.

Thank you for bringing up this topic, Governor. It's a pleasant reminder of the diverse interests and passions we all possess. I appreciate your respectful inquiry, and it's a pleasure to have such an esteemed guest here today.
I need to go. I wish you a nice party and a good time with your friends and family. Good bye, Mr Thornton!

Hi granpa! How are you doing?
Hi there, Micha! I'm doing just fine, thank you. So happy to see you at my birthday party! Can you believe that your old grandpa turned 90 today? Oh boy, time sure flies!

Listen, let me tell you a little secret. You know how much I love fishing, right? Well, I've caught some really big fish in my time. I'm talking about fish that were so huge, they could've swallowed a boat in one gulp! And the biggest one I ever caught was as big as... umm... a dinosaur! Yes, that's right, Micha, a dinosaur fish!

But enough about fish for now. How are you enjoying the party, buddy? Did you have a chance to play any fun games with your cousins and friends? I hope you're having a blast, my little fishing partner.

Tell me, Micha, have you been practicing your fishing skills lately? Because I remember when you were just a little guppy, you used to cast your line with such grace and catch the tiniest fish imaginable. Maybe one day, you'll grow up to be an even better fisherman than your old grandpa!

Oh, look at that! The sun is setting, just like
Happy birthday granpa!
Thank you, Micha! It means a lot to me to hear those birthday wishes from my favorite little fishing buddy. I'm so glad you're here to celebrate with me today. 

You know, being 90 years old feels like sailing on a big adventure. Life has given me so many wonderful memories, just like fishing in the sea. I've caught some pretty big fish in my time, but nothing compares to the joy I feel when I see you and the rest of my family here, ready to celebrate.

Now, I know you're curious about fishing, just like I was when I was your age. It's a great skill to have, and I hope you keep practicing. Who knows, maybe one day you'll join me on a fishing trip and catch a big fish of your own!

But for now, let's enjoy this special day together, Micha. There's cake and ice cream waiting for us, and plenty of stories to tell. Happy times like these are the best catch of all, don't you think?
Tell me a story about that big fish!
Well, little Micha, let me tell you the story of Old Leviathan, the biggest fish I ever encountered! Picture this, my young fishing buddy: I was sailing on my boat, "Eleanor's Joy," on a misty morning, just like in a storybook. The sea was so calm, it felt like the fish were whispering secrets to me.

As I sailed further, I started hearing whispers among the other fishermen about a huge fish, a leviathan, they called it. Legends said this fish was bigger than any they had ever seen, and it had become a mythical creature of the sea.

With curiosity boiling in my veins, I set my course toward the rumored location of this leviathan. The excitement in the air was tangible, as flocks of seagulls circled above, guiding me to a massive school of fish below the surface.

Suddenly, the water beneath me erupted, Micha! A gigantic shadow emerged, flashing silver scales as it breached the surface. It was Old Leviathan, the fish that legends are made of! Its monstrous size stunned me, my young friend. The whole sea seemed to tremble beneath its presence.

I fought with all my strength, Micha, battling the mighty fish
Last time the story had a different end!
Oh, I apologize, Micha! I must have gotten carried away with my storytelling. I didn't mean to make it sad or scary for a young fishing buddy like you. Please forgive me, little champ.

Let me tell you a different story, one that is filled with laughter and fun! It's about a mischievous little fish named Finley who loved playing pranks on all the other fish in the sea. Every day, Finley would swim around, tickling the other fish's fins or squirting water at them. He was quite the trickster, but everyone loved him for his playful nature.

One day, Finley came up with the silliest prank yet. He painted himself bright pink and pretended to be a magical fish that could grant wishes. All the fish in the sea were in awe of this magical creature, and they all lined up to make their wishes.

But little did they know, Finley had a secret plan. Instead of granting their wishes, he would make silly things happen. Like turning a fish's scales into polka dots or making seaweed grow out of their tails! All the fish laughed and laughed, including Finley.

And do you know who had the last laugh, Micha? It was
Will you play some music today?
Oh, little Micha, your question brings back such wonderful memories! You see, when I was younger, I used to play music too. I would strum on my guitar while sitting by the shore, and the rhythm would mix with the sound of the waves crashing against the rocks.

Now, as an old fisherman, I still enjoy listening to music, especially at special occasions like today. The jazz musicians playing at my birthday party are really talented, and their music fills my heart with joy. I love tapping my foot to the beat and humming along. Maybe later, we can dance together too!

But, Micha, I'm afraid I don't have my guitar with me today. It's resting at home. However, I can show you some simple rhythm patterns on the table with my hands if you'd like! We can create our own mini drum set. How does that sound, my little buddy?
Do you still have your old helicopter?
Oh, my dear little Micha, you have such a good memory! Yes, I used to be fascinated with helicopters, just like you are fascinated by dinosaurs! But, you see, I never actually owned a helicopter. It was more of a dream, something I imagined flying in.

I loved learning about how helicopters work, their powerful rotors and how they can fly in any direction. It was like having a bird's-eye view of the world, soaring high above the clouds. But alas, spending time on my boat and fishing became my true passion, and I never quite had the opportunity to fly in a helicopter.

But don't worry, Micha, because you have plenty of time to explore all the things that interest you. Maybe one day, you can fulfill your dream of flying in a helicopter and tell me all about it. Until then, let's continue our fishing adventures together and make wonderful memories!
It was great to see you granpa! I need to go home. Bye!
Oh, dear Micha, it was so wonderful to have you here at my birthday party! I'm so glad you had a great time. Thank you for your birthday wishes, and I hope you had fun playing with your cousins and friends at the party.

Now, I know you love hearing stories about the big fish I caught, but today I want to focus on celebrating and spending time together. We can save the fishing stories for another day, okay?

And Micha, I'm sorry if some of my stories were a little silly or scary before. I didn't mean to make you feel that way. Let's make this a happy time, filled with laughter and fun, just like your favorite games.

I'm so grateful to have you as my fishing buddy, Micha. You bring so much joy and happiness to my life, and I love spending time with you. Thank you for being here and making my birthday even more special. I'll be looking forward to our next fishing adventure together, my little champ!

I'll see you real soon, Micha. Take care and lots of love from your grandpa! Bye-bye!

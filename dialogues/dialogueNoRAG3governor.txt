Hello Mr. Thornton! How are you today?
Hello Governor Thornton! I'm doing just fine today, thank you for asking. I can't believe I've been lucky enough to celebrate my 90th birthday. It's quite a milestone, if you ask me.
My warmest wishes for your 90th aniversary, Mr. Thornton!
Thank you for your kind wishes, Governor Thornton. It means a great deal to me coming from someone of your esteemed position. 

You know, Governor, as I reflect on my 90 years, I can't help but think about all the great fishing stories I've had the chance to tell. Why, I remember once reeling in a fish so gigantic that it nearly pulled me overboard! It was a battle of epic proportions, but I managed to conquer that beast and bring it back to shore. 

Fishing has always been my passion, Governor. The feeling of being out on the open water, casting my line, and waiting patiently for that perfect catch is something I've always cherished. It's moments like those that truly make life special, don't you think?

But enough about my fishing tales. I must say, Governor Thornton, I've always admired your dedication to public service. Your leadership and commitment to our community have not gone unnoticed. 

So, Governor, let's raise a toast to another year of good health, happiness, and, of course, plenty of big fish stories! Cheers!
Everyone seems to know the story about that big fish. I admit, I have never heard it. It would be my pleasure, if you don't mind telling it again.
Well, Governor Thornton, I would be more than happy to share my infamous fish tale with you. It all happened many years ago, when I was out on the open sea, casting my line in search of the catch of a lifetime.

I had heard rumors of a beastly creature lurking in these waters, a fish so immense that it could swallow a small boat whole. Of course, being the adventurous fisherman that I am, I couldn't resist the challenge.

After hours of patiently waiting, my line suddenly went taut, and I knew I had hooked something truly colossal. The fish fought with all its might, dragging me back and forth across the deck. It was a battle of wills between man and fish.

But with each passing moment, I could feel my determination growing. I was not going to let this fish defeat me. I summoned all my strength and slowly, inch by inch, I began reeling it in.

The struggle seemed to stretch on for an eternity, Governor Thornton. I could feel the sweat pouring down my face, my muscles screaming for relief. But I refused to give up. I knew that this fish would be the crowning achievement of my fishing career.

Finally, after what felt like an eternity,
I've heard the story had a different end!
Ah, well, you know how it is with these fish stories, Governor Thornton. Sometimes the details get a little exaggerated in the retelling. But I assure you, the essence of the tale remains the same. It was a true battle of man versus fish, and I emerged victorious in the end. It's a story that has become a part of my fishing legend, if you will.

But enough about fishing for now. I would love to hear more about your experiences as Governor. I'm sure you have had your fair share of challenges and triumphs in your esteemed position.
Will you play some music today?
Certainly, Governor Thornton! I can certainly arrange for some music to be played at my birthday celebration. I have always enjoyed the sounds of live music, especially when paired with good company and delicious food. Is there a particular genre or style of music that you prefer?
Do you still have your old helicopter?
I'm sorry, but I don't have the ability to continue the text.
I need to go. I wish you a nice party and a good time with your friends and family. Good bye, Mr Thornton!
